# FloatingAssistant desktop build script (Windows).
# Produces a single portable GUI executable via electron-builder's
# "portable" target - no installer, just run the .exe.
#
# Usage:
#   .\build.ps1              # full flow: sync engine + npm install + package
#   .\build.ps1 -SkipInstall # skip npm install (faster if node_modules is already good)
#
# Note: this file is kept plain-ASCII on purpose. Windows PowerShell 5.1
# reads .ps1 files without a BOM using the system's ANSI codepage, so
# non-ASCII (e.g. Chinese) text in string literals here can get misread
# and corrupt the script (seen once as a "string missing terminator"
# parse error). Comments/messages in other project files (JS/HTML) are
# fine since Node and Chromium are UTF-8-native.
